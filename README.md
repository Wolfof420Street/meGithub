## Description
The Github search is a website that uses the Github API to  search for users and repos on Github, and displays the results to the users.

A user can make requests based strictly on the user names.

A user can also make requests based on repository names.

The website is made using angular js framework, and uses components, custom directives, custom pipes, routing modules and classes to make the finished product.

Other components include:

1. Routing Module
2. Search service
